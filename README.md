This is a battle Caculator I made for the: Diplomacy 5 - Galactic Empire, Kriegsspiel game.
It was made on google scripts attached the the main document, that I also helped make, containing sensitive infomation about the game that can not be shared right now.
On the sheet an umpire selects a team on each side, selects the battle targeting and priority and hits a button that runs the calculateBattle function.
Results are displyed on a oage on the main google sheet.
